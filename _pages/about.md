I study materials under different environments to understand why they behave the way they behave. The electronic and atomic arrangements almost every time can explain the physical behavior of a material. My job and interest drive me to look into the materials like various metals and alloys right from the bulk scale to atomic scales.

My current research includes:
•Multi-modal study of microstructural evolution under shear deformation.

•Insitu gas-metal reactions to capture the early stages of phase transformations using reaction chambers in transmission electron microscopes and atom probe tomography instrument.

•Micro-structural characterization of phase evolution in high entropy alloys, nickel-based superalloys beta Ti alloys, and bulk metallic glasses under extreme environments such as high temperature, pressure, oxidation, and so on.

•Study of factors affecting shear localization–microstructure-property correlation.

•Investigation of deformation mechanisms in metallic materials–quasi-static and high-strain rate loading (using Split Hopkinson pressure bar)

•Identification of potential material vulnerabilities – quantify material damage evolution using multi-scale microstructural and mechanical characterization techniques.

•Implementation of combinatorial techniques for high through-put analysis–compositionally graded alloy deposition using Laser Engineering Near-net Shaping(LENS) for rapid microstructure-property assessment.

•In-situ analysis of phase transformations and failure mechanisms using synchrotron XRD

High-level proficiency in using 3-D Atom Probe (LEAP), Transmission Electron Microscopy (diffraction contrast imaging, HRTEM, STEM), Focused Ion Beam Microscopy (FEI), Advanced Photon Source-Synchrotron (Measurements and Data Analysis), Brazilian Synchrotron (LNLS, Campinas), X-Ray Diffraction Measurements and Analysis.
Also, expertise in chemical and structural characterization techniques using metallography, Nova SEM, ESEM, EBSD, EDX & XRF spectrometer, mechanical testing of materials such as Microhardness testing, Tensile Testing, Impact Testing And Hardness testing (Rockwell, Vickers), Cupping Test, EDM, Split Hopkinson's pressure bar testing and familiar with ASTM standards
