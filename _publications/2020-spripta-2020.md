title: "Influence of non-magnetic Cu on enhancing the low temperature magnetic properties and Curie temperature of FeCoNiCrCu(x) high entropy alloys"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/6/1/2020-spripta-2020
excerpt: 'The microstructure and magnetic properties of three face-centered cubic (FCC) FeCoNiCrCu(x) high entropy alloys (HEAs) (x = 0, 0.5, 1) are investigated. Interestingly, addition of the nonmagnetic element Cu to FeCoNiCr HEA is found to enhance exchange interactions and low temperature saturation magnetization. The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic Curie transition temperature increases from 85 K for FeCoNiCr to 118 K for FeCoNiCrCu. This is counterintuitive since Cu is nonmagnetic; however, atom probe tomography revealed Cu rich clusters containing 5 at% Ni and 1 at% each of Fe, Co, Cr, within FCC matrix, these clusters altered the matrix composition and consequently its magnetic properties.'
