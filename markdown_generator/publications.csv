5/5/2017,Optimizing the coupled effects of Hall-Petch and precipitation strengthening in a Al0. 3CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy,Elsevier Materials & Design,"A successful demonstration of applying integrated strengthening using Hall-Petch strengthening (grains size effect) and precipitation strengthening is shown in the fcc based high entropy alloy (HEA) Al0.3CoCrFeNi, leading to quantitative determinations of the Hall-Petch coefficients for both hardness and tensile yield strength, as well as the enhancements in the yield strength from two distinct types of ordered precipitates, L12 and B2. An excellent combination of yield strength (~ 490 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (~ 850 MPa), and ductility (~ 45% elongation) was achieved by optimizing and coupling both strengthening mechanisms, resulting from a refined grain size as well as both L12 and B2 ordered precipitates. This opens up new avenues for the future development of HEAs, with the appropriate balance of properties required for engineering applications.",121,Hall-Petch,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S026412751730206X
3/16/2020,Hierarchical Eutectoid Nano-lamellar Decomposition in an Al0.3CoFeNi Complex Concentrated Alloy,Nature Scientific Reports,"This paper reports a novel eutectoid nano-lamellar microstructure that has been discovered in a relatively simple Al0.3CoFeNi high entropy alloy (HEA) or complex concentrated alloy (CCA). This novel eutectoid nano-lamellar microstructure presumably results from the complex interplay between Al-mediated lattice distortion (due to its larger atomic radius) in a face-centered cubic (FCC) CoFeNi solid solution, and a chemical ordering tendency leading to precipitation of ordered phases such as L12 and B2. This eutectoid microstructure is a result of solid-state decomposition of the FCC matrix and therefore distinct from the commonly reported eutectic microstructure in HEAs which results from solidification. This novel nano-lamellar microstructure exhibits a tensile yield strength of 1074 MPa with a reasonable ductility of 8%. The same alloy can be tuned to form a more damage-tolerant FCC + B2 microstructure, retaining high tensile yield stress (~900 MPa) with appreciable tensile ductility (>20%), via annealing at 700 °C. Such tunability of microstructures with dramatically different mechanical properties can be effectively engineered in the same CCA, by exploiting the complex interplay between ordering tendencies and lattice distortion.",,Hierarchical-Eutectoid,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-61538-6
4/3/2020,Dynamic Shear Deformation of a Precipitation Hardened Al0.7CoCrFeNi Eutectic High-Entropy Alloy Using Hat-Shaped Specimen Geometry,MDPI Entropy,"Lamellar eutectic structure in Al0.7CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) is emerging as a promising candidate for structural applications because of its high strength-ductility combination. The alloy consists of a fine-scale lamellar fcc + B2 microstructure with high flow stresses > 1300 MPa under quasi-static tensile deformation and >10% ductility. The response to shear loading was not investigated so far. This is the first report on the shear deformation of a eutectic structured HEA and effect of precipitation on shear deformation. A split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was used to compress the hat-shaped specimens to study the local dynamic shear response of the alloy. The change in the width of shear bands with respect to precipitation and deformation rates was studied. The precipitation of L12 phase did not delay the formation of adiabatic shear bands (ASB) or affect the ASB width significantly, however, the deformed region around ASB, consisting of high density of twins in fcc phase, was reduced from 80 µm to 20 µm in the stronger precipitation strengthened condition. We observe dynamic recrystallization of grains within ASBs and local mechanical response of individual eutectic lamellae before and after shear deformation and within the shear bands was examined using nano-indentation",,entropy-2020,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/4/431/htm
6/1/2020,Influence of non-magnetic Cu on enhancing the low temperature magnetic properties and Curie temperature of FeCoNiCrCu(x) high entropy alloys,Scripta Materialia,"The microstructure and magnetic properties of three face-centered cubic (FCC) FeCoNiCrCu(x) high entropy alloys (HEAs) (x = 0, 0.5, 1) are investigated. Interestingly, addition of the nonmagnetic element Cu to FeCoNiCr HEA is found to enhance exchange interactions and low temperature saturation magnetization. The paramagnetic to ferromagnetic Curie transition temperature increases from 85 K for FeCoNiCr to 118 K for FeCoNiCrCu. This is counterintuitive since Cu is nonmagnetic; however, atom probe tomography revealed Cu rich clusters containing 5 at% Ni and 1 at% each of Fe, Co, Cr, within FCC matrix, these clusters altered the matrix composition and consequently its magnetic properties.",,spripta-2020,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359646220301135
9/1/2020,Compositionally graded high entropy alloy with a strong front and ductile back,materialstoday communications,"Material components with graded properties can be ideal for many advanced applications due to their seamless nature of microstructural transition, cost reduction and high resistance of failure. A compositionally graded AlXCoCrFeNi (x = 0.3–0.7) high entropy alloy composite build was additively manufactured using laser engineered net shaping (LENS™). In this high throughput production process, the elemental composition of Al-Co-Cr-Fe-Ni powders in the hoppers were varied and the feed rates were tuned to create a laminate of Al0.3CoCrFeNi and Al0.7CoCrFeNi layers, with a 500 μm wide transition zone of intermediary composition. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy along the build direction verified the elemental composition matching closely with the targeted compositions. X-ray diffraction revealed the Al0.3CoCrFeNi to be a single-phase face centered cubic (fcc) structure whereas Al0.7CoCrFeNi had dual phase fcc + B2. Scanning electron microscopy was used to capture the microstructural features in the two layers as well as the transition zone. The massive shift in mechanical properties of hardness, dynamic strength and work hardening rates in this graded composite have been discussed. With this endeavor, microstructural complexity of HEAs has been combined with unique advantage of LENS™ to achieve ingenious path to fabricate materials suited applications demanding variable strength and ductility/toughness.",,materialtoday-2019,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352492819301047
8/13/2019,A novel nano-particle strengthened titanium alloy with exceptional specific strength,Nature Scientific Reports,"Various ecological and economical concerns have spurred mankind’s quest for materials that can provide enhanced weight savings and improved fuel efficiency. As part of this pursuit, we have microstructurally tailored an exceptionally high-strength titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-6Mo (Ti6246) through friction stir processing (FSP). FSP has altered the as-received bimodal microstructure into a unique modulated microstructure comprised of fine acicular α″-laths with nano precipitates within the laths. The sequence of phase transformations responsible for the modulated microstructure and consequently for the strength is discussed with the help of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies. The specific strength attained in one of the conditions is close to 450MPa m3/mg, which is about 22% to 85% greater than any commercially available metallic material. Therefore, our novel nano particle strengthened Ti alloy is a potential replacement for many structural alloys, enabling significant weight reduction opportunities.",,scripta-2019,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-48139-8

10/18/2019,Simulation of solute clusters in metallic systems,Modelling and Simulation in Materials Science and Engineering,"The arrangement of atoms in the microstructures of alloys plays a key role in defining their physical and functional properties. These microstructures are studied to detect deviations from the expected homogeneous distribution using frequency distribution tests and cluster detection algorithms on reconstructions obtained from atom probe microscopy. However, it is challenging to evaluate and validate the performance of these algorithms using the reconstructed data because of the experimental limitations of the atom probe data itself. Low detector efficiency and reconstructional artifacts may lead to loss of existing clusters, or introduce heterogeneities that do not reflect the original arrangement. Additionally, retrieving atom probe data is a time and cost-prohibitive process. These challenges call for the use of simulated datasets with known concentrations and distributions to evaluate algorithms that analyze distributions or detect clusters. In this paper, we extend the existing methodology to simulate the creation of solute clusters in very dilute solutions for any solution. We propose methods to create denser and wider clusters in any solution irrespective of the concentration. Three novel solute cluster simulation techniques incremental, hierarchical and gravitational clustering are presented and compared in this paper. The simulated datasets can be used to validate and compare the performance of frequency distribution or cluster discovery algorithms. We compare the cluster analysis results obtained from the single linkage algorithm and DBSCAN to highlight the utility of these datasets.",,iop-2019,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-651X/ab4b3d/meta
